git branches- basically it is used so to make the changes not in live project but in another branch and when the updates are successful 
we can simply merge them

how it works-

git commit :changes in main branch
git branch foo :created a new branch foo
git checkout foo :now will be making changes in foo branch (main live code not effected)
git commit -(in foo)
git checkout main(to get back to mai)
git merge foo (Now will integrate the changes)
